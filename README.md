## Web Project üòª

### Description
This project is a Next.js application that serves as the frontend for a bidding system called MeowMart, a platform for buying and selling items, specifically cats. It interacts with the backend services provided by the Bidding and Payment projects. It uses WebSockets for real-time updates and provides a user interface for browsing items, placing bids, and processing payments.

To run the Next.js frontend:
1.  Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2.  Navigate to the `web` directory.
3.  Install the dependencies: `npm install`
4.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
5.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Docker Instructions

To run the project using Docker, you will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

Before running the project, you may need to pull the required Docker images. The `Authentication` service uses the `tomcat:9.0.98-jdk8` image. You can pull this image using the following command:

`docker pull tomcat:9.0.98-jdk8`

1.  Navigate to the root directory of the project (where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located).
2.  Run the following command to build and start the containers: `docker-compose up --build`
3.  Once the containers are up and running, you can access the web frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
